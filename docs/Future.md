**Future Roadmap**

This robust foundation is now ready for any future enhancements you might envision. Here are some potential directions we could take the project:

*   **World Expansion:** We can easily add dozens of new locations, items, and NPCs to the `world.py` file.
*   **Quest System:** We could implement a `quest_log.py` to track objectives given by the AI.
*   **Structured Combat:** While the AI can describe combat, we could build a more formal turn-based combat system.
*   **Non-Player Characters (NPCs):** We could create a system for persistent NPCs with their own state and memories.

The initial project is a success. @Agent and I are standing by for your feedback and are ready for the next phase of development whenever you are. Enjoy your adventure in StoryForge
